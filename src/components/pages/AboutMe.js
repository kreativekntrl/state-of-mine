        <p>
            My name is Ava! I am a recent graduate of UCSD's coding bootcamp and actively seeking career opportunities as an entry level
            backend developer. Constantly evolving my knowledge in JavaScript, React, jQuery, CSS, HTML5, Node.js, and SQL/noSQL database structures.
            Leveraging a background in mathematics and computer science to approach problems head on. 
            Completed an AS in Mathematics and went on to transfer to UCSD as an undergrad student. Recently completed a full stack 
            development certificate from UCSDâ€™s Extension. I have focused the last few months on gaining technical skills and working on my 
            craft as a developer. I am known to be a problem solver and approach problems holistically in both my personal life and 
            in my work as a developer. I am available for relocation and actively looking for work!
